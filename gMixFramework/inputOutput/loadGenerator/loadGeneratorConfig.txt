GENERATE_LOAD_ON = APPLICATION_LEVEL
#	possible values:
#		- APPLICATION_LEVEL: the load generator will generate payload and send 
#		  it through a layer 4 socket (see options below)

#
SCHEDULE_AHEAD = 1000
#	to decrease memory usage the load generator will schedule packets during
#	load generation. the load generator will try to have always scheduled 
#	"SCHEDULE_AHEAD" packets in addition to the packet currently sent
#
TOLERANCE = 2500
#	in microsec; displays a warning if the load generator is more than 
#	"TOLERANCE" microsec behind the schedule (i.e. if messages 
#	are sent later than specified in the trace file)
